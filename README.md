# clj-grpc

Implements [instructions from a blog post](https://blog.jmibanez.com/2018/07/22/grpc-with-clojure-and-leiningen.html) on how to use gRPC in Clojure.
There may be other ways, but this one leverages the java server generated by gRPC. 
**DOES NOT SPEAK JSON**  

## Generated Sources
The `generated-sources-snapshot` folder holds exactly that- a version controlled copy of output written to 
`target/generated-sources`during a past build. They aren't used in the build and are only present to make it 
easy to see what the output looks like.

## Installation

    brew update
    brew cask install java
    brew install clojure
    brew install leiningen

## Usage
From root of this project:

    ./scripts/build
    ./scripts/run
